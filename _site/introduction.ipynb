        "##### **Summary**\n",
        "Since its inception in 2008, Spotify has been hailed as a transformative model for media industries. Numerous tech startups aimed to replicate this \"Spotify for X\" concept in various domains like books, movies, journalism, and art, but most of these attempts failed. This article, through an analysis of Swedish and US news articles from 2008 to 2018, reveals that the metaphor of \"Spotify\" evolved in diverse ways. The initial idea of relying on advertising to offer \"free but legal\" consumption was abandoned in favor of subscription-based models. Additionally, streaming services, including Spotify, witnessed a shift toward curation and algorithmic recommendation systems, which introduced new dimensions to the \"Spotify for X\" metaphor. \n",

        "##### **Summary**\n",
        "The advent of the internet has opened up new avenues for product distribution, such as online stores and streaming platforms, offering a wide array of products. Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping customers discover products that align with their preferences on these platforms. However, the existing literature highlights the challenge of insufficient research-appropriate data for recommender system development.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this data scarcity issue, this article introduces a music recommendation system that utilizes a dataset containing the listening habits of users who share their current music choices on the microblogging platform Twitter. Since this dataset receives daily updates, the article proposes the use of a genetic algorithm that enables the recommender system to adapt its input parameters to the continuously expanding dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the evaluation phase, the article compares the performance of the newly introduced recommender system to two baseline approaches. The results indicate that the proposed recommender system shows promising performance and significantly outperforms the baseline methods.\n",
